It seems it is a standard bug in MR reporter. The current workaround is to increase sync time (for users and companies) from 5 minutes(default). I suggest to put 1h. Need to execute the following command on aa and restart Management reporter on bb

 SELECT T.NAME, 
CASE TS.STATETYPE
WHEN 3 THEN 'PROCESSING'
WHEN 5 THEN 'COMPLETE'
WHEN 7 THEN 'ERROR'
END AS STATETYPE,
TS.PROGRESS, TR.ID AS TRIGGERID,
CASE TR.ISENABLED
WHEN 1 THEN 'ENABLED'
ELSE 'DISABLED'
END AS NAMESTATUS,
TR.INTERVAL,
CASE TR.UNITOFMEASURE
WHEN 2 THEN 'MINUTES'
ELSE 'SECONDS'
END AS INTERVALTIMING, 
TS.STATETYPE,
T.TYPEID,
TS.LastRunTime AS [LAST RUN],
TS.NextRunTime AS [NEXT RUN]
FROM SCHEDULING.TASK T JOIN SCHEDULING.TASKSTATE TS
ON T.ID = TS.TASKID JOIN SCHEDULING. [TRIGGER] TR ON TR.ID = T.TRIGGERID 
WHERE ISENABLED <> 0 AND Interval > 10


SELECT * FROM scheduling.[Trigger]  WHERE Id = '115A87BB-232A-4857-9C82-E9AFD41AB425' 
SELECT * FROM scheduling.[Trigger]  WHERE Id = '1682ECB0-53FD-4313-9465-8446CB4205F4' 

/*
UPDATE  scheduling.[Trigger]  set  Interval =  3600   WHERE  Id = '115A87BB-232A-4857-9C82-E9AFD41AB425' 
UPDATE  scheduling.[Trigger]  set  Interval =  3600   WHERE  Id = '1682ECB0-53FD-4313-9465-8446CB4205F4'
